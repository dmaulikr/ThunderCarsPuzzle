# ThunderCarsPuzzle
Game ThunderCarsPuzzle is a game for children to age of three with purpose of guessing the same images
The whole application has been worked dinamically. In the upper screen part there are 8 images in color and in the middle part of the screen in a frame there are 8 black&white images. Upper images have pan gestures and they can be moved and black&white images are static. When you move certain image with pan gesture it becomes larger to the same height and width as black&white image. Before relising the picture it has to be placed on the same black&white image and its X and Y spot has to be higher than the X and Y spot of the black&white image. If you put image correctly it will replace that image or if not it will be placed on the certain place in the view and it will be counted as wrong move. In the lower part of the screen are two labels: for affected and missed images and a restart button. When you click on the restart button you change the positions of pictrures which is random
